# Tourio

This project represents the starter for Recap Project 6.

**Tourio** is the friend of all travelers: it displays sights you want to visit and lets you edit them.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

## Tasks

### Read Data

- Set up a database; use the [`lib/db.json` file](lib/db.json) to insert sample data.
- In `pages/api/index.js`, replace the `places` variable imported from `lib/db.js` with a `GET` request from your database.
- Do the same in `pages/api/[id]/index.js` for the details page.

### Create Form

- In `pages/create.js`, write the `addPlace` function to start a `POST` request.
- Write the `POST` API route in `pages/api/places/index.js`.
- Submitting the form should redirect the user to the homepage `/`.

### Update Entry

- In `pages/places/[id]/edit.js`, write the `editPlace` function to start a `PATCH` request.
- Write the `PATCH` API route in `pages/api/[id]/index.js`

### Delete Entry

- In `pages/places/[id].index.js`, write the `deletePlace` function to start a `DELETE` request.
- Write the `DELETE` API route in `pages/api/places/[id]/index.js`.

## Deploy to Vercel

- Deploy your app to Vercel and make sure the deployment can access the cloud database with the help of environment variables.
